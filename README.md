# my_cash
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of the "myCash" application, a simulation of a mobile financial service similar to bKash in Bangladesh. The C++ program includes features such as user registration, login, secure financial transactions, transaction history, and data persistence.

Key Features:

User Management: Efficient storage and management of member data, including mobile numbers, names, account balances, and PINs.
Registration System: Users must register to use the service, with checks to prevent duplicate registrations.
Menu-Driven Interface: A user-friendly interface with options for updating profile, sending money, cashing in/out, paying bills, and more.
Secure Identification: Members are identified using mobile numbers, and sensitive operations are protected with One-Time Passcodes (OTPs).
Transaction History: Detailed recording of financial transactions, providing transparency and accountability.
Data Persistence: User data is saved to an external file ("members.txt") for persistence across sessions.
How to Use:
